Quantum Computing and Information Theory
Alice Johnson

This manuscript explores the foundations of quantum computing and its relationship to classical information theory.

Introduction

Quantum computing represents a paradigm shift in computational theory. Unlike classical computers that operate on bits (0 or 1), quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits that can exist in superposition states.

The fundamental principles are:
- Superposition: qubits can be in multiple states simultaneously
- Entanglement: qubits can be correlated in ways impossible classically
- Interference: quantum states can interfere constructively or destructively

Basic Concepts

A qubit state can be written as:
  |ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩

where α and β are complex amplitudes satisfying |α|² + |β|² = 1.

Quantum gates operate on these states through unitary transformations. The Hadamard gate creates equal superposition:
  H|0⟩ = (|0⟩ + |1⟩)/√2

Applications

Quantum algorithms promise exponential speedup for certain problems:
- Shor's algorithm: integer factorization
- Grover's algorithm: database search
- Quantum simulation: modeling quantum systems

Conclusion

While quantum computing is still in early stages, it offers profound implications for cryptography, optimization, and scientific simulation. Future research must address decoherence, error correction, and scalability challenges.
